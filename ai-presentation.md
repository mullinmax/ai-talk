## 400: Image Generation and Copyright
### Slide: Overview
Generative models like stable diffusion raise copyright issues. Almost overnight AI-generated images have become cheap, accessible, and hard to distinguish from real images. This has implications for copyright, misinformation, and more.

### Slide: Copyright
These image generation models are frequently trained on copyrighted images. This raises questions about the legality of using these models to create new images. The US Copyright Office has ruled that AI-generated images are not eligible for copyright protection, but this is a complex and evolving area of law.

are generated images copyrightable? yes, the human portions of them (like the prompt, settings, edits after the fact) are copyrightable. The AI portion is not.
